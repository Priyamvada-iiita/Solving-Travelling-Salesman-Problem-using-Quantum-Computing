#Solving-Travelling-Salesman-Problem-using-Quantum-Computing

Research Work: Intersection of quantum computing and the resolution of NP-hard problems, focusing primarily on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). 

Quantum computing is a rapidly emerging field with the potential to revolutionize many industries, including medicine, materials science, and finance. Quantum computers use the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations that are impossible for classical computers. One of the most important applications of quantum computing is solving NP-hard problems, which are problems that are difficult for classical computers to solve, even with exponential resources.

Quantum computing utilizes quantum mechanics to tackle complex problems beyond classical computers' capabilities. Key advantages include parallel processing through qubits' superposition and entanglement, enabling linked qubits to share the same fate. Despite being in early stages, quantum computing achieved milestones, such as Google's quantum supremacy in 2019.

Promisingly, quantum computing excels in solving optimization problems, exemplified by the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Quantum algorithms like QAOA show potential in efficiently exploring multiple routes simultaneously, outperforming classical counterparts.

In conclusion, the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been successfully addressed using Quantum Variational Eigensolver (VQE) on gate model quantum computers, where the problem is transformed from QUBO to Ising. Additionally, D-Wave annealers have provided alternative solutions. Noteworthy observations include the contrast in handling constraints: classical solvers strictly adhere, while quantum solutions turn constraints into soft constraints that may be violated.

At first glance, neither gate model quantum computers nor D-Wave Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) exhibit a clear quantum advantage over classical solvers. However, a notable advantage emerges as the number of cities increases, with the time taken showing at most linear growth rather than exponential.

As technology advances, there is potential for quantum solutions to outperform classical methods, especially as quantum computing matures. The prospect of overcoming classical limitations in tackling complex optimization problems, like the TSP, remains an exciting avenue for future exploration and development.

While still developing, quantum computing's transformative potential spans various industries. Recent accessibility enhancements, exemplified by tools like Qiskit, enable broader exploration and experimentation. Quantum computing is no longer a distant concept but an emerging reality with the capacity to revolutionize diverse fields.
